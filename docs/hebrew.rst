Transliteration


We are aiming at something simple to aid in pronunciation, not for scholarly purposes. SBL General is what we want to standardize on. Logos has a tool to do this automatically. If you don't have access to Logos, ask Bram to do it.

Four-line Examples


Line 1: Hebrew with the term in question bolded 

Line 2: Simple transliteration as described above

Line 3: Literal representation of Hebrew in the order of the Hebrew words, with meaning contained in individual words represented with English words connected by dashes. Necessary grammatical information can be given with abbreviations in capitals. This allows the reader to track the words with the meaning in the words.

Line 4: Smooth English translation

Examples:

וְהָאֹורֵ֡ב קָם֩ מְהֵרָ֨ה מִמְּקֹומֹ֤ו

weha'owrev qam meherah mimmeqowmow

and-the-lying-in-ambush stood quickly from-place-of-him


The soldiers hiding in ambush quickly rushed out of their place

וַיִּקַּ֣ח אָ֠סָא אֶת־כָּל־הַכֶּ֨סֶף וְהַזָּהָ֜ב

wayyiqqah 'asa 'eth-kol-hakkesef wehazzahav

and-he-took Asa [dir.obj]_all_the-silver and-the-gold

Then Asa took all the silver and gold


Grammatical notations for the literal line 3 of examples will use short abbreviations in lower case within square brackets, as above (e.g., [dir.obj]). Others that might possibly be needed would be: [masc], [fem], [sing], [pl], [dual], [?]. Others?

Citations


* There is no need to directly quote.
* We should be careful not to lift groups of examples from any one grammar.
* Citations are for the team, not the final product.
* In the final product, there may be an acknowledgements page listing grammars consulted, but don’t do anything that would necessitate a citation.
