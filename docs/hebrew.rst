Transliteration
We are aiming at something simple to aid in pronunciation, not for scholarly purposes. SBL General is what we want to standardize on. Logos has a tool to do this automatically. If you don't have access to Logos, ask Bram to do it.

Citations
There is no need to directly quote.
We should be careful not to lift groups of examples from any one grammar.
Citations are for the team, not the final product.
In the final product, there may be an acknowledgements page listing grammars consulted, but donâ€™t do anything that would necessitate a citation.
